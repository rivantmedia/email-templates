# Google Workspace Automation

This repository contains a collection of scripts and tools to automate tasks in Rivant Media's Google Workspace.

As of writing this README, we use the Google Apps Script to automate tasks in Google Workspace. The Google Apps Script is a cloud-based scripting language based on JavaScript that lets you automate tasks across Google products and third party services.

## Why use Google Workspace Automation?

It would be very easy to use some very specific app that does exactly what we need, but mostly apps like this are not free and we would have to train people to use these apps. We can use Google Workspace Automation to automate tasks in Google Workspace and make it easier for our team to use.

This also has the added benefit of having everything in one place. It makes is insanely easy to manage access.
